Once navagating to the Exoplanet Comparison Application there is a brief description of what an exoplanet is, and that
    the information available in this application is from NASA's database. The user then clicks the "display exoplanet" button and a randomly selected exoplanet is populated into the DOM. The user then has five buttons to 
    explore information about the alien world.  
        The planet's name is provided, and for each planet the five fields of information include:
        1. The planet's host star and its distance from our own star.  
        2. The amount of time it takes this alien world to orbit its host star.
        3. The exoplanet's radius size in comparison to our own planet's radius and a to scale graphic.
        4. Using the planet's mass and radius size the planet's gravitaional acceleration is calculated, and a user         is able to input their weight and unit of measurement (lbs or kg).  This function calculates roughly            how much the user would weigh if standing on the surface of the exoplanet.
        5. The final button opens a link to a web page with further information about the exoplanet and its star.  At       The bottom of this web page are further links to publications specifically about the exoplanet.
